		<h1>About Deng</h1>

		<img src="img/Chongjia Deng.jpg" alt="Deng">

		<p> I am a college student at Brooklyn college. My major is Computer and Science. I can speak C ++, java and Python. I am very interested in developing games. In my free time, I will make some small games at home and publish them on the Internet (the development software is <a href="https://www.renpy.org/">Renpy</a>). It is some even reading novels visually. In the next year, I will graduate. Friends who want to learn computer technology can have technical exchanges with me.</p>
